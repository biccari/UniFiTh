** Class information ************************************************

      UniFiTh is a LaTeX class to typeset theses that adhere to
      "University of Florence"'s guidelines for publishing.

      It is compatible with two compilation methods:
      pdflatex and xelatex.

      The documentation is provided in the file unifith-doc.pdf.

      The version number of this class is reported at the top of the
      class file unifith.cls and in the pdf manual
      unifith-doc.pdf.



** Installation instructions ****************************************

      UniFiTh can be installed in 3 different ways:
	  
	  1. The simplest way to install UniFiTh is by the package manager
      of your TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX or MacTeX).
      
      2. Instead, if you want to install UniFiTh manually, you have to
      download the unifith.zip archive from CTAN or, better, from
      the official UniFiTh website
      http://biccari.altervista.org/c/informatica/latex/unifith.php
      The unifith.zip archive contains: 
        1. unifith.cls (main file)
        2. unifith-doc.pdf (manual of unifith.cls)
        3. unifith-doc.tex (source of the manual)
        4. README (this file)
        5. unifilogo.pdf (university logo)
		6. examples folder with several examples of usage
        7. unifith.bst (an english BibTeX style)
	  You can simply copy unifith.cls and unifith.bst
      together with unifilogo.pdf into your local work 
	  directory where your thesis files will live.
	  
      3. The last possibility is copying the files of UniFiTh
	  (discussed in the previous point) into your texmf tree
      (or your localtexmf tree) at these locations:
	    <texmf>/tex/latex/unifith/unifith.cls
	    <texmf>/tex/latex/unifith/unifilogo.pdf
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/unifith-doc.pdf
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/unifith-doc.tex
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/examples/*.tex
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/README
	    <texmf>/bibtex/bst/unifith/unifith.bst
      Then, you need to update the file database.
