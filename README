      The "University of Florence" logo is a registered
      EU trademark of the "University of Florence" university.
      The logo can be used only according to the "Il logo di Ateneo,
      linee guida per lâ€™uso corretto" document available, with
      other information, at the following link (in italian):
      https://www.unifi.it/upload/sub/comunicazione/piano/3_logo.pdf
      In particular it can be used in the theses of
      "University of Florence" without explicit authorization.



** Class information ************************************************

      UniFiTh is a LaTeX class to typeset theses that adhere to
      "University of Florence"'s guidelines for publishing.

      It is compatible with two compilation methods:
      pdflatex and xelatex.

      The documentation is provided in the file unifith-doc.pdf.

      The version number of this class is reported at the top of the
      class file unifith.cls and in the pdf manual
      unifith-doc.pdf.



** Installation instructions ****************************************

      UniFiTh can be installed in 3 different ways:
	  
	  1. The simplest way to install UniFiTh is by the package manager
      of your TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX or MacTeX).
	  Since the logo of the University cannot be uploaded on the TeX
	  distribution repositories, you will get a Warning on the
	  frontispiece of the thesis. You can click on this warning to
	  obtain the original logo.
      
      2. Instead, if you want to install UniFiTh manually, you have to
      download the unifith.zip archive from the official UniFiTh website
      http://biccari.altervista.org/c/informatica/latex/unifith.php
	  or from CTAN.
      The unifith.zip archive contains: 
        1. unifith.cls (main file)
        2. unifith-doc.pdf (manual of unifith.cls)
        3. unifith-doc.tex (source of the manual)
        4. README (this file)
        5. unifilogo.pdf (university logo, not in CTAN repository)
		6. examples folder with several examples of usage
        7. unifith.bst (an english BibTeX style)
	  You can simply copy unifith.cls and unifith.bst
      together with unifilogo.pdf into your local work 
	  directory where your thesis files will live.
	  Since the logo of the University cannot be uploaded on the TeX
	  distribution repositories, if you have used the package from CTAN,
	  you will get a Warning on the frontispiece of the thesis. You can
	  click on this warning to obtain the original logo.
	  
      3. The last possibility is copying the files of UniFiTh
	  (discussed in the previous point) into your texmf tree
      (or your localtexmf tree) at these locations:
	    <texmf>/tex/latex/unifith/unifith.cls
	    <texmf>/tex/latex/unifith/unifilogo.pdf
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/unifith-doc.pdf
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/unifith-doc.tex
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/examples/*.tex
	    <texmf>/doc/latex/unifith/README
	    <texmf>/bibtex/bst/unifith/unifith.bst
      Then, you need to update the file database.
	  Since the logo of the University cannot be uploaded on the TeX
	  distribution repositories, you will get a Warning on the
	  frontispiece of the thesis. You can click on this warning to
	  obtain the original logo.
